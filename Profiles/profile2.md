## Clay Davenport

Clay Davenport, a straight, cisgender white man enjoys a moderately successful career as an entrepreneur at age 35. As he works in the tech sector, his working environment always changes, requiring constant training and vigilance on technology trends to remain employed and relevant. His circle of friends has greatly diminished in recent years as he goes through his greatest struggle: a messy divorce.

The custody battle for his five children – Tyson (10), Melanie (8), Brent (5), Kyle (3), and his newborn, Alisha – is complicated. Due to a huge bonus months ago, he was able to purchase a two-storey dwelling in Vancouver, after receiving advice from his lawyer that he would need enough space for young children to accommodate their high energy levels. Now, wages for his line of work have gone down as automation has greatly reduced the need for specialists in his sub-field. His ex-wife, Hannah, wants to reduce the weekends he has with the kids to Fridays after school to Saturdays, as she claims that he is and wants a minimum of 10k a month for expenses, as she’s working part-time.

Clay refuses. Every ambition he has in life relates to his children – he wants high paying jobs so he can provide them the best quality in life, whether vacationing abroad or funding all expenses related to post-secondary. Some say he’s compensating for not knowing his birth parents and various foster homes and to those individuals, take your high faluting ideas and shove it; this is only about my children and not about me.

He feels his wife is only looking out for herself and the reduction in time with his children is only an excuse to increase monetary compensation for herself. Recently, his family doctor recommended testing with a psychologist regarding ADHD. Clay worries about this being weaponized in court by Hannah because there have been incidents in the past that have angered her, such as dropping a glass and it breaking because he forgot it was in his hand, forgetting to pick up Tyson and Melanie from school once, and going through long periods of boredom and inattentiveness when Hannah tried to tell him about her struggles. He also worries that comorbidity may come into play with an official diagnosis.

He suspects Hannah has been vilifying him to Tyson and Kyle since the last few visits, they have kept to themselves whereas Melanie, the most headstrong of them all, and Brent seem to get along better and speak to him much more now than in the past. There seems to be strange alliances forming and one of his parenting obstacles to bringing his children together.

Coincidentally, he and his birth sister, Anna, met and since then, they have been best friends. She and her welcoming family support him any time he needs it. She has two children, 8 and 6, and he’s happy his children have cousins to play with. Clay feels as much love with her as he does hate with Hannah. Anna’s daughter Lyla, 11, shows talent in skiing and he supports Anna with scheduling, training and pickup/drop-offs for coaching sessions.
