## Ola Austin

Ola Austin is a Person of African Descent of 42-year-old, trans non-binary provincial government worker who identifies as queer. Due to their past, filled with turbulence because of numerous discriminatory incidents and events, they have high anxiety, deep depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and low scale paranoia. There is one specific hate crime they have never recovered from: two white, cisgendered females pushed and cornered Ola into an alleyway shortly after their transition and assaulted them. In that incident, the responding constables stated, “there’s no way two tiny chicks did that to you”, which led Ola to believe that a stereotype of females being gentle was being applied on the attackers.

Ola currently mistrusts police and is suspicious of all police activity around them. Because healthcare resources haven’t considered Ola’s complex situation and intersectionality, they haven’t been able to receive adequate care for both mental and physical health; bleeding has been a common occurrence since their surgery.

Their current work environment creates more instances of trauma because their coworkers have refused all optional gender equity training, and often speak disparagingly of gender equity in front of Ola. Ola looks stereotypically female and constantly needs to remind everyone of their pronouns. When they bring up the subject of pronouns, there is constant pushback from their coworkers, stemming mainly from the notion that only two genders can exist.

In their personal life, their relationship with their family members is strained and recently, their father has fallen sick. Ola now experiences less ostracization, because their mother needs assistance, and has a chance to create a healthy relationship with their parents again. They travel every two weeks to Prince George from Victoria and every trip, Ola needs to brace themself for overt racist incidents, such as not being served and enduring hate speech at gas stations. They find these trips to be exhausting because these instances create more emotional burden to carry. These trips also create strain in their finances as they make 43k/yr and needs to stretch their budget often to accommodate their two kids, a daughter of 15 years and a son of 17 years.

They are a supportive of their son, Ash, who is currently questioning his identity. Ola finds themself increasingly annoyed with their daughter, Lina, who has been recently complaining about “how terrible her life is because she cannot buy new makeup palettes from Sephora every release, like her friends can”.

Ola receives moderate financial assistance from their ex, Sam. He has numerous financial responsibilities and debt, because his business isn’t doing well currently. He helps with the kids - Sam and Ola have a respectful relationship with one another - but it’s limited only to parenting. Ola uses the financial assistance for high school fees, such as field trips and supplies. They suspect Sam wants their kids, specifically Lina, to spend more time with him as he easily connects to her cisgender qualities. Ash’s relationship with his father Sam is currently strained due to disagreements about Ash’s identity.
