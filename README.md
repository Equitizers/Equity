## 1.1 Privacy, Security and Data
Tier | Mindset | Content
------------ | ------------- | -------------
0 | Denial | <ul><li>"Confirmation Bias": Data collection uses an unauthorized, passive and casual approach, such as conversations among selected and immediate colleagues, and stereotypes are common within the Product, demonstrating the absence of knowledge of systemically oppressed groups.</ul></li><ul><li>Data is used for surveillance capitalism, in which substantial cost-savings are sought no matter the risk and protection of the Product, contributing to, maliciously or not, six degrees of traumatic impacts, with the potential of lasting more than one generation.</ul></li><ul><li>More time is spent planning than building the framework of the Product with residential experts but without a complex feedback system, prioritized feedback or an understanding of the Product's impact to all communities in the Province.</ul></li><ul><li>Product is outdated in all aspects prior to release.</ul></li>
1 | Polarization | <ul><li>Privacy and security efforts are based on capital, property and public relations and do not take into account layers of systemic oppression, individual and/or community rights, vulnerabilities and challenges; discussions are frequent to streamline processes and avoid incidents, however this is the limit of capacity.</ul></li><ul><li>"Hypervisibility": Because confidential data collection is unavailable, systemically oppressed folx experience further ostracization due to the fear of retaliation, being simply forgotten about and/or forced into the default of the dominat group, to which the Product team is indifferent to due to team homogenity.</ul></li><ul><li>"Walking on Thin Ice": Minority-centric project elements are acknowledged with fear of open conflict among product team and stakeholders, creating inequalities and large data gaps in research and communications.</ul></li><ul><li>Product data are collected from random sample(s) of users instead of all users who implement, maintain, and use the product; often data collection is unconsensual and derived from the Product team's assumptions of an individual/community, which are based on infrequent and specific instances.</ul></li>
2 | Minimization | <ul><li>The Product team explores open and big data, intentions, information sharing, security and privacy risks prior, though the exploration is embedded with bad or wrong questions and solutions; emotional labour of minorities for learning purposes is common.</ul></li><ul><li>Product's data is collected from management with the assumption that data collection is substantial and methodical; socio-economic status is a strong barrier to qualitative and quantitative feedback.</ul></li><ul><li>Minority feedback is censored and/or reworded as it is considered political; the default state of being is thought to be the current dominant group.</ul></li><ul><li>Product's feedback process follows antiquated methodology, is irregular, biased or non-existant - feedback is only being initiated if a large problem is brought forward or a large investment is involved.</ul></li>
3 | Acceptance | <ul><li>"Quick wins": There is a shift in acknowledging complexities of the Province as they are seen as unavoidable and unable to be segregated among ministries, divisions and branches; the Product team works intersectionally and connects with respective experts for consultations when necessary instead of focusing on tasks that will leverage them politically internally.</ul></li><ul><li>Government is beginning to be perceived as a civic community as the Product Team cultivates, or begins to, their relationships with Provincial communities, inclusive of those who advocate against aggregated and deaggregated data due to committed physcial and psychological harms, for the purpose of improving society living standards.</ul></li><ul><li>Indigenious peoples are not monolithed and their Sovereignity, as well as OCAP, is acknowledged and respected; there is, or the beginnings of, an open communication channel in regards to the Product's impacts, negative, neutral and/or positive, on their respective lands, peoples, policies and laws.</ul></li><ul><li>The promise to integrate the Respectful Relationship, specificially the public participation specturm and E-GAP, is captured in a way which accenutates the authentic partnership between the Product team and Provincial communities and abolishes performative efforts.</ul></li>
4 | Adaption | <ul><li>"The Grandmother Prespective": The Prodct team's objective of data collection and utilization is to protect human rights and modernize infrastrature and services for everyone; marketing and capitalistic characteristics of data collections are actively challenged and overcome..</ul></li><ul><li>"Innovation": Application of intersectional learning is always in motion and failing forward is normalized to embed the four elements of deaggregated data (emotion, mind, spirit and body) and align new psyschological and physical findings regarding wholesome health.</ul></li><ul><li>Self-Assessment tools include Equity Impact Assessments for Provincial communities and the robust feedback system incorporates empathy, confidentiality, and open-ended questions.</ul></li><ul><li>Security reviews are conducted weekly to maintain momentum between modern risks and threats, and the progressive era of fortified civil rights acknowledgement.</ul></li>

## 1.2 GBA+ 
Tier | Mindset | Content
------------ | ------------- | -------------

1 | Polarization | <ul><li>Censorship is common because the default individual of interest is a white, older, cishet married, male who has a typical family and incorporating diverse folx, who have not been acknowledged politically, is considered political and causes agitiation; low resiliency to diversity is common. </ul></li><ul><li>Though the Product's foundation is for everyone, the product group engages with the ally industrial complex in regards to equity.</ul></li><ul><li>Indeginity and diverse identity factors are seen seen as a concept that needs to be segregated and addressed in specific ministries rather than a cross-government initiative.</ul></li><ul><li>Consideration of Provincial communities, or diverse populations, is a burden, and though collaboration is sought, resistance to being equitable because the Product team does not see this affecting the majority; rather than amplifying the voice of those who are not representated by ontological staff, their concerns are ignored or overpowered.</ul></li>
2 | Minimization | <ul><li>"Don't Rock the Boat": Positive culture is prominent, as is positive communications, and this directly relates to maintaining fragility in work, progress and mindsets, undermining progress through conflict; any perceived negative feedback is taken personally.</ul></li><ul><li>Product collaboration between divisions and ministries are in forming stages, with minimal champions, and reputation building is underway; the same issues of conformity is replicated throughout this process as the Product team has not confronted their biases and stereotypes.</ul></li><ul><li>"Stepping on Toes": Feelings of exclusion centres on challenging the default culture and staff often feel undermined, unhappy and threatened, taking away from the core issues of systemically oppressed groups being excluded from the same living standards as privilieged folx.</ul></li><ul><li>Combination of anti-oppression langauge and vocabulary is only considered when there is a complaint, political initiative and/or scandals.</ul></li>

0 | Denial | <ul><li>"Western Caste System": Product decisions are centred top-down and maintains the interest, care and/or unjust distribution of power and voice of those with higher socio-economic status.</ul></li><ul><li>"Firefighting": Generational planning is compromised because priorities are changed without change management tactics; this approach demonstrates the majority and higher socio-economic status for shallow reasons.</ul></li><ul><li>Infantilizing employees and clients, internal or external, is normalized in which authoratative representatives approve decisions feel they know what is best for an individual, team or organization, without considering 6 degrees of trauma or empowerment.
